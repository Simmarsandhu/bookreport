                <p>As soon as Binya saw the beautiful blue silk umbrella, she wanted it.<br> She wanted it so badly that she was willing to give her lucky leopard's claw pendant in exchange. <br>
                    No one in the village had such a fine umbrella, <br>and everywhere Binya went the umbrella went, too.<br>
                     Gradually it faded to a pale blue and was patched in several places,<br> but there were still many who envied Binya her treasured possession.<br> And the most envious of them all was old Ram Bharosa,<br> the shopkeeper who decided that by some means he must own the blue umbrella.</p>
